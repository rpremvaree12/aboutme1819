    <h1>Mr. Premvaree</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>I am a physics and computer science teacher who currently lives in West Orange, NJ. I grew up in Las Vegas, NV and I am in my 6th year of teaching in the NYC Dept. of Ed. I am also a Math for America Master Teacher. When I'm not coding, you can find me training for marathons, reading about cognitive science research and playing strategy board games.

      <p>I like to cook and pretty much cook every day of the week. I usually binge watch tv shows. Right now I’m super into Forged in Fire which is kind of like cooking but for knives.</p>

    <p>I REALLY don't like cats and cats DON’T like me. If I'm near a cat, they always somehow nuzzle me to death.</p>
